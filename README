This is a comprehensive README file for your Streamlit application, acknowledging all the Python libraries used for both the multilingual interface and the core language processing components (Japanese and English).

# 🌐 Multilingual Tokenizer & Tagger Web App

This is a Streamlit application designed for batch processing and linguistic annotation of text files. It supports multiple languages, providing tokenization, Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, and lemmatization, then compiling the results into standardized XML files (TreeTagger format) for easy corpus analysis.

## ✨ Features

  * **Multilingual Support:** Currently supports Japanese and English.
  * **Batch Processing:** Upload one or more `.txt` files in a single session.
  * **Accurate Tagging:** Uses high-quality, dedicated NLP libraries for each language.
  * **Standardized Output:** Results are formatted as tab-separated values (token\\tPOS\\tlemma) enclosed in a single XML file per input, then compressed into a single downloadable ZIP archive.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack & Acknowledgements

This application is built entirely using Python and several powerful open-source libraries.

| Component | Library | Purpose | Acknowledgement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Web Framework** | `streamlit` | Creates the interactive, shareable web interface. | Streamlit, Inc. |
| **Japanese NLP** | `fugashi` & `unidic-lite` | Provides efficient tokenization, POS tagging, and lemmatization using MeCab with the UniDic dictionary. | @polm (Fugashi), NAIST (UniDic) |
| **English NLP** | `nltk` (Core) & `nltk.corpus` | Provides tokenization, robust Part-of-Speech tagging, and accurate WordNet-based lemmatization. | The NLTK Project |
| **Data Handling** | `pandas` | Used internally for robust handling and manipulation of tabular data. | The pandas development team |
| **File Compression** | `zipfile`, `io` | Manages the creation and delivery of the ZIP archive in memory. | Python Standard Library |

## 🚀 Deployment

### Prerequisites

To deploy this application, you must have the following files in your root repository directory:

1.  `app.py` (The main application script)
2.  `requirements.txt` (The dependency list below)

### `requirements.txt`

The following packages are required for a successful installation and execution of the application on platforms like Streamlit Cloud:

```text
streamlit
pandas
fugashi
unidic-lite
nltk
```

### Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]
    cd [YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME]
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

The application will automatically attempt to download the necessary NLTK data files (`averaged_perceptron_tagger`, `wordnet`, `punkt`) on first run and cache them.

## 📝 XML Output Format

The output XML file for each processed text adheres to the following structure:

```xml
<corpus lang="[LANG_CODE]" id="[FILENAME_ID]">
TOKEN_1    POS_TAG_1    LEMMA_1
TOKEN_2    POS_TAG_2    LEMMA_2
...
</corpus>
```
